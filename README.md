Project Horiseon

In this project, I worked on the website to make it manageable and accessible by adding links, alt attributes, and semantic features to help viewers understand the images
in case they do not render. I checked that the headings were ordered sequentially and noted my changes in the CSS file.

I built this project so viewers have an easy access to the page and if the page doesn't render correctly there is still detail for them to understand the basics of the page. I learned to refactor code to make it cleaner and easier to understand.
